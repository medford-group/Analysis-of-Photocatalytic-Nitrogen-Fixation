abstract = {We describe an experimental method to probe the adsorption of water at the surface of isolated, substrate-free TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) based on soft X-ray spectroscopy in the gas phase using synchrotron radiation. To understand the interfacial properties between water and TiO2 surface, a water shell was adsorbed at the surface of TiO2 NPs. We used two different ways to control the hydration level of the NPs: in the first scheme, initially solvated NPs were dried and in the second one, dry NPs generated thanks to a commercial aerosol generator were exposed to water vapor. XPS was used to identify the signature of the water layer shell on the surface of the free TiO2 NPs and made it possible to follow the evolution of their hydration state. The results obtained allow the establishment of a qualitative determination of isolated NPs' surface states, as well as to unravel water adsorption mechanisms. This method appears to be a unique approach to investigate the interface between an isolated nano-object and a solvent over-layer, paving the way towards new investigation methods in heterogeneous catalysis on nanomaterials.},

abstract = {The dependence of the surface properties of thin rutile TiO2 (110) films on the number of layers in two- dimensional slab models has been investigated with first-principles methods based on density-functional theory. A pronounced oscillation of the interlayer distances, surface and adhesion energies, and electronic structure as a function of the number of layers has been found. The effect can be explained by surface-induced hybridization of Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals among the layers. This leads to reinforced interactions between the first and second layers and to weaker bonding and longer distances between the second and third layers of the films. By removing the 3d orbitals from the Ti basis set we found that TiO2 behaves almost exactly as the isostructural SnO2 (110) surface. The results are of importance for the properties of epitaxial ultrathin films grown on metal substrates as well as for single crystal surfaces.},

abstract = {We have used density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the adsorption and first dissociation step of ammonia on both clean and Pt-covered TiO2 rutile (110) surfaces. On clean rutile TiO2 (110) surface, NH3 and NH2 prefer to chemisorb on the five-coordinated titanium (Ti5c) site, and H is adsorbed favorably on the bridging oxygen (O1) site, while a single Pt atom prefers to adsorb on the hollow (H2) site. It is found that the preadsorbed Pt atom enhances significantly the adsorption of NH3, NH2 and H species on rutile TiO2 (110) surface by binding with Pt adatom directly. It is also found that the first dissociation step of ammonia (NH3???NH2+H) on the clean rutile TiO2 (110) surface is endothermic by 0.89eV, and no transition state exists. In addition, the first dissociation step of ammonia on Pt-covered rutile TiO2 (110) surface is found to be endothermic by only 0.43eV, but presents an activation energy barrier of 1.82eV. A comparison of the adsorption and first dissociation step of ammonia on rutile TiO2 (110) surface with and without Pt adatom has been discussed. Investigations indicate that the adsorbed Pt adatom on clean rutile TiO2 (110) surface not only changes the surface electron structure, but also varies the reaction pathways by participating in the reaction. It is expected that our results would provide useful information for the development of catalyst for NH3 dissociation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Developing an accurate simulation method for the electrochemical stability of solids, as well as understanding the physics related with its accuracy, is critically important for improving the performance of compounds and predicting the stability of new materials in aqueous environments. Herein we propose a workflow for the accurate calculation of first-principles electrochemical phase (Pourbaix) diagrams. With this scheme, we study the electrochemical stabilities of Ti and Ti oxides using density-functional theory. First, we find the accuracy of an exchange-correlation functional in predicting formation energies and electrochemical stabilities is closely related with the electronic exchange interaction therein. Second, the metaGGA and hybrid functionals with a more precise description of the electronic exchange interaction lead to a systematic improvement in the accuracy of the Pourbaix diagrams. Furthermore, we show that accurate Ti Pourbaix diagrams also require that thermal effects are included through vibrational contributions to the free energy. We then use these diagrams to explain various experimental electrochemical phenomena for the Ti--O system, and show that if experimental formation energies for Ti oxides, which contain contributions from defects owing to their generation at high (combustion) temperatures, are directly used to predict room temperature Pourbaix diagrams then significant inaccuracies result. In contrast, the formation energies from accurate first-principles calculations, e.g., using metaGGA and hybrid functionals, are found to be more reliable. Finally to facilitate the future application of our accurate electrochemical phase equilibria diagrams, the variation of the Ti Pourbaix diagrams with aqueous ion concentration is also provided.},

abstract = {The initial step of O-2 evolution reaction on a TiO2 surface is a long-standing puzzle. A recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment showed that the H2O molecule adsorbed on rutile TiO2(110) surface could decompose under ultraviolet illumination (Tan, S. J.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 9978). The underlying reaction mechanism is now examined by our GGA+U study, in which the oxidation of the H2O molecule by both free and trapped holes has been carefully investigated. It is found that the transfer of the hole trapped at the bridge oxygen to the molecule is hindered by the mismatch between the energy and spatial symmetry of the trapped hole orbital and the highest occupied molecule orbital of H2O. The entire oxidation reaction has a high energy barrier and is barely exothermic. In contrast, the oxidation of the molecule by the free hole is energetically more favorable. The free hole is transferred to the H2O molecule via the in-plane oxygen atom when the molecule stays in the transient dissociation state. This mechanism may also be applicable to the photooxidation of other R OH type molecules adsorbed on the rutile TiO2(110) surface.},

abstract = {Systematic temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies of NO adsorption and reactions on rutile TiO2(110)-1??????1 surface reveal several distinct reaction channels in a temperature range of 50???500??K. NO readily reacts on TiO2(110) to form N2O, which desorbs between 50 and 200??K (LT N2O channels), which leaves the TiO2 surface populated with adsorbed oxygen atoms (Oa) as a by-product of N2O formation. In addition, we observe simultaneous desorption peaks of NO and N2O at 270??K (HT1 N2O) and 400??K (HT2 N2O), respectively, both of which are attributed to reaction-limited processes. No N-derived reaction product desorbs from TiO2(110) surface above 500??K or higher, while the surface may be populated with Oa's and oxidized products such as NO2 and NO3. The adsorbate-free TiO2 surface with oxygen vacancies can be regenerated by prolonged annealing at 850??K or higher. Detailed analysis of the three N2O desorption yields reveals that the surface species for the HT channels are likely to be various forms of NO dimers.},

Using the domain-based pair natural orbital local correlation concept (DLPNO-CCSD(T)), these calculations can be performed on systems with hundreds of atoms at an accuracy of about 99.9{\%} of the canonical CCSD(T) method. This allows for ab initio calculations providing reference adsorption energetics at solid surfaces with an accuracy approaching 1 kcal/mol. This is an invaluable asset, not least for the assessment of density-functional theory (DFT) as the prevalent approach for large-scale production calculations in energy or catalysis applications. Here we use DLPNO-CCSD(T) with embedded cluster models to compute entire adsorbate potential energy surfaces for the binding of a set of prototypical closed-shell molecules (H2O, NH3, CH4, CH3OH, CO2) to the rutile TiO2(110) surface.

abstract = {We study the energetics and structure of water absorption on the ideal rutile TiO2 (110) surface using dispersion-corrected periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and on-site Coulomb potential (DFT+U) corrections. Conventional (PBE) and self-consistent dispersion-corrected DFT methods (vdw-DF1 and vdw-DF2) both suggest that molecular adsorption of intact water molecules on the rutile (110) surface is increasingly preferred with increasing simulation slab thickness. However, empirical dispersion corrections indicate a mix of molecular and dissociated water may coexist at room temperature, with less dependence on slab thickness. This same behavior is seen for DFT+U with U = 3 eV in combination with or without self-consistent dispersion corrected DFT. We find that the preference for the occurrence of dissociated water increases with increasing U. When compared with experimental bond-length data for the adsorbed water species, none of the methods and slab thicknesses correctly predict all bond lengths simultaneously. However, of the methods that energetically favor coexisting associated and dissociated water species on the surface, the three-layer slab with conventional DFT (PBE) and the empirically dispersion-corrected DFT methods come closest to correctly reproducing all of the experimentally observed bond lengths. We conclude that the current level of DFT is insufficient to definitively distinguish between the fully associated and partially dissociated states of water adsorbed on the pristine rutile (110) surface, due to the very small (0.1 eV) total energy differences between these states.},

In the spin-polarized solutions, the excess electrons generated by oxygen reduction occupy localized band-gap states formed from Ti (3d) orbitals, in agreement with experimental findings. In addition, the inclusion of spin polarization substantially lowers the energy of all the systems studied, when compared with spin-paired solutions.

Adsorbed D2O, 13CH2O, or 15NO react reductively at these Ti3+ sites to produce D2, 13C2H4, and 15N2O, respectively. The oxygen atoms in the adsorbate molecules are preferentially extracted by the substrate TiO2 surface. The deoxygenation of adsorbates is accompanied by the oxidation of surface Ti3+ sites. The yield of reduction products (D2, 13C2H4, and 15N2O) is therefore proportional to the coverage of surface oxygen vacancies. No deoxygenation reactions are observed on the fully oxidized (defect-free) surface. This unique property of the surface provides a convenient method to quantitatively detect the relative coverage of Ti3+ sites on the TiO2 (110) surface.},

abstract = {Periodic density functional theory calculations of nitric oxide conversion on the Ag/rutile(110) surface have been performed and compared to the anatase(100) surface [Mazheika, A. S.; Bredow, T.; Ivashkevich, O. A.; Matulis, V. E. J. Phys. Chem. C. 2012, DOI: 10.1021/jp308393p]. Two complementary theoretical approaches were employed based on plane waves and on the linear combination of Gaussian-type orbitals, respectively. NO adsorption on the rutile(110) surface covered with Agn clusters (n = 2, 4, 8) was studied. For Ag8/rutile(110), two energetically most stable adsorption sites were found: at the border between the silver cluster and the surface and on the silver particles. In the absence of reducing agents, the further stages of NO decomposition are similar to those obtained on Ag/anatase(100). The adsorption of an additional NO molecule results in the formation of an acyclic cis-ONNO dimer. This is followed by the fragmentation of (NO)2 by breaking one or two N-O bonds. The main product of the on-cluster decomposition is molecular nitrogen, while at-border decomposition leads to the formation of N2O. In the on-cluster case, a rather stable dimer structure is formed, which is not directly decomposed. This intermediate can only be decomposed after isomerization to other dimer structures. Similar to the case of Ag/anatase(100), the Ag/rutile(110) surface is oxidized by remaining O atoms after NO decomposition. These O atoms can form NO2 according to an Eley-Rideal mechanism with other NO molecules adsorbed from the gas phase. From the calculated reaction energies, it is concluded that NO conversion on Ag/anatase(100) is more feasible than on Ag/rutile(110).},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio thermodynamics are applied in order to investigate the most stable surface and subsurface terminations of Mo 2C(0 0 1) as a function of chemical potential and in the presence of syngas. The Mo-terminated (0 0 1) surface is then used as a model surface to evaluate the thermochemistry and energetic barriers for key elementary steps in syngas reactions. Adsorption energy scaling relations and Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships are established and used to place Mo 2C into the context of transition metal surfaces. The results indicate that the surface termination is a complex function of reaction conditions and kinetics. It is predicted that the surface will be covered by either C 2H 2 or O depending on conditions. Comparisons with transition metals indicate that the Mo-terminated Mo 2C(0 0 1) surface exhibits carbon reactivity similar to transition metals such as Ru and Ir, but is significantly more reactive toward oxygen. This explains some previous observations for Mo 2C catalysts and suggests that Mo 2C may exhibit unique and potentially useful reactivity or selectivity patterns. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {XPS and periodic DFT calculations have been used to investigate water sorption on the TiO2 rutile (1 1 0) face. Two sets of XPS spectra were collected on the TiO2 (1 1 0) single crystal clean and previously exposed to water: the first set with photoelectrons collected in a direction parallel to the normal to the surface; and the second set with the sample tilted by 70, respectively. This tilting procedure promotes the signals from surface species and reveals that the first hydration layer is strongly coordinated to the surface and also that, despite the fact that the spectra were recorded under ultra-high vacuum, water molecules subsist in upper hydration layers. In addition, periodic DFT calculations were performed to investigate the water adsorption process to determine if molecular and/or dissociative adsorption takes place. The first step of the theoretical part was the optimisation of a dry surface model and then the investigation of water adsorption. The calculated molecular water adsorption energies are consistent with previously published experimental data and it appears that even though it is slightly less stable, the dissociative water sorption can also take place. This assumption was considered, in a second step, on a larger surface model where molecular and dissociated water molecules were adsorbed together with different ratio. It was found that, due to hydrogen bonding stabilisation, molecular and dissociated water molecules can coexist on the surface if the ratio of dissociated water molecules is less than 33{\%}. These results are consistent with previous experimental works giving a 10-25{\%} range. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The adsorption and photochemistry of N2O chemisorbed on TiO2 powder has been investigated. At 157 K, nitrous oxide is molecularly adsorbed on the reduced titanium dioxide. Adsorption on the TiO2 surface takes place through both the N and O ends of the nitrous oxide molecule. The photochemistry of the adsorbed N2O molecules was studied at 157 K by use of UV irradiation in the range 2.1-5.0 eV. The photoactivity of the adsorbed molecule is dependent on the N2O coverage. At low coverages, the adsorbed N2O is photodepleted to produce adsorbed nitrogen. Larger coverages of N2O are not photodepleted to N2 due to the site blocking in the adsorption process. N-bonded species show a higher photoreactivity than the O-bonded species. Photoformation of NO was not observed at any N2O coverage. },

These reactions are important for the photo-catalytic reduction of NO in exhaust gas, but yet little is known about the mechanisms or the intermediates involved. The combination of high-quality ultrahigh vacuum FTIRS data with large scale embedded cluster calculations using an accurate hybrid density functional rendered it possible to identify and assign unambiguously vibrational frequencies for nine species which are formed upon adsorption and reaction of NO on rutile TiO(2). Some of them have been observed for the first time. As a result of the quantum chemical calculations we can report for all adsorbates accurate structures and binding energies.},

abstract = {Recently several theoretical studies have examined oxygen adsorption on the clean, reduced TiO2(110) surface. However the photocatalytic behavior of TiO2 and the scavenging ability of oxygen are known to be influenced by the presence of surface hydroxyls. In this paper the chemistry of O2 on the hydroxylated TiO2 surface is investigated by means of first-principles total energy calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. TheMD trajectories show a direct, spontaneous reaction between O2 and the surface hydroxyls, thus supporting the experimental hypothesis that the reaction does not necessarily pass through a chemisorbed O2 state. Following this reaction, the most stable chemisorbed intermediates are found to be peroxide species HO2 and H2O2. Although these intermediates are very stable on the short time scale of MD simulations, the energetics suggests that their further transformation is connected to a new 300 K feature observed in the experimental water temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum. The participation of two less stable intermediate states, involving terminal hydroxyls and/or chemisorbed water plus oxygen adatoms, to the desorption process, is not supported by the total energy calculations. Analysis of the projected density of states, however, suggests the possibility that these intermediates have a role in completing the surface oxidation immediately before desorption. Introduction},

With the aid of (NO)2 dimer adsorption anisotropy, the bidentate configuration of the cis-(NO)2 dimer on fivefold coordinated Ti5c(4+) cation sites was clearly confirmed. The (NO)2 dimer converts to N2O on Ti5c(4+) cation sites at higher NO dosage on both oxidized and reduced surfaces, rather than at Vo sites. The (NO)2 --{\textgreater} N2O conversion is independent of the presence of Vo on TiO2(110) surfaces.

Here we propose a different model in which we impose no constraints, allowing all coordinates including the 2D slab itself to relax.We perform DFT calculations on both models.We find that the unconstrained slabs yield better agreement with experimental results and they have lower total energies. The optimized 2D lattice constants of the unconstrained slabs eventually converge to the attached bulk value. The total energy difference reveals that, with odd number trilayers, the unconstrained slab is much closer to the corresponding constrained slab. The surface energies both converge to the individual values with the number of atomic layers. Key},

@article{Zeng2015,
abstract = {Electrochemical potential/pH (Pourbaix) diagrams underpin many aqueous electrochemical processes and are central to the identification of stable phases of metals for processes ranging from electrocatalysis to corrosion. Even though standard DFT calculations are potentially powerful tools for the prediction of such diagrams, inherent errors in the description of transition metal (hydroxy)oxides, together with neglect of van der Waals interactions, have limited the reliability of such predictions for even the simplest pure metal bulk compounds, and corresponding predictions for more complex alloy or surface structures are even more challenging. In the present work, through synergistic use of a Hubbard U correction, a state-of-the-art dispersion correction, and a water-based bulk reference state for the calculations, these errors are systematically corrected. The approach describes the weak binding that occurs between hydroxyl-containing functional groups in certain compounds in Pourbaix diagrams, corrects for self-interaction errors in transition metal compounds, and reduces residual errors on oxygen atoms by preserving a consistent oxidation state between the reference state, water, and the relevant bulk phases. The strong performance is illustrated on a series of bulk transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) hydroxides, oxyhydroxides, binary, and ternary oxides, where the corresponding thermodynamics of redox and (de)hydration are described with standard errors of 0.04 eV per reaction formula unit. The approach further preserves accurate descriptions of the overall thermodynamics of electrochemically relevant bulk reactions, such as water formation, which is an essential condition for facilitating accurate analysis of reaction energies for electrochemical processes on surfaces. The overall generality and transferability of the scheme suggests that it may find useful application in the construction of a broad array of electrochemical phase diagrams, including both bulk Pourbaix diagrams and surface phase diagrams of interest for corrosion and electrocatalysis},

@article{Henderson1996,
abstract = {The interaction of water with the (110) crystal face of TiO2 (rutile) was examined with high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). Water desorption occurred in three sequential TPD features as a function of exposure at 270, 175 and 155 K, ascribed to monolayer, second layer and multilayer states, respectively. Estimation of the extent to which water molecularly versus dissociatively adsorbed on the TiO2(110) surface was attempted by comparing HREELS and TPD data. Very low water exposures (below 7 x 1013molecules/cm2) dissociatively adsorbed at 135 K to surface hydroxyl groups (v(OH) = 3690 cm- 1), but molecular adsorption (v(OH) = 3420 - 3505 cm- 1 and $\delta$(HOH) = 1625 cm- 1) resulted from additional water exposure. The appearance of molecular water in HREELS coincided with a red-shift in the OH stretching frequency of the hydroxyl, presumably due to the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions with the adsorbed water molecules. Little or no additional water dissociation occurred during heating of the monolayer as inferred from HREELS. Second layer water on TiO2(110) was evident in HREELS by OH stretching intensity below 3400 cm- 1 indicative of hydrogen-bonding. However, the OH stretching mode of monolayer water molecules was not red-shifted by the presence of second layer water suggesting that protons on monolayer water molecules were not involved in hydrogen-bonding second layer water molecules. The influence of second layer water on subsequent layers was evident in both HREELS and TPD.},

abstract = {First-principles calculations based on density-functional theory and the pseudopotential method are used to investigate the energetics of adsorption of the series of molecules H2O, CH3OH, H2O2 and HCO2H on the TiO2(110) surface. The aim of the work is to elucidate the factors that determine whether the adsorption is molecular or dissociative, including the acidity of the molecule, the geometry and electrostatic properties of the surface, and the interaction between adsorbed species. It is shown that the theoretical methods reproduce experimental values of the gas-phase heterolytic and homolytic dissociation energies to reasonable accuracy (within ∼20kJmol−1 for all four molecules). We find that the adsorption energy for the most favourable molecular mode of adsorption is extremely close to that for dissociative adsorption in the cases of H2O, CH3OH and H2O2. For HCO2H, dissociative adsorption is favoured by a substantial margin, provided the dissociated geometry preserves the equivalence of the two oxygens in the formate ion. It is also shown that the geometry of the TiO2(110) surface plays a crucial role in determining the conformations of the most stable geometries, and that hydrogen bonding between adsorbed species is also important.},
